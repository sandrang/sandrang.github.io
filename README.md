##CIT MINOR
I like CIT. Going into this minor I had no idea what this all was or what it was about. It looked very complicated at first and I sometimes I wanted to cry because the codes did not work, but then I realized that it was okay because I had great people help me with it. I thank Yebo Feng and Michael Hennessey the most because they helped me get through the hardships of this class :)

Topics learned in CIT:
* css
* html
* Github
* hacking
* Databases
* JavaScript
* hackertyper.net
* Being frustrated about code and wanting to cry is okay
* The professors and GEs are all great
