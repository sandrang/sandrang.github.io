  <h1>Sandra Nguyen</h1>
  <p>I am tired and I want to sleep. I am double majoring in Advertising and Cinema Studies and minoring in CIT. I plan to use all of these skills to my advantage in the future to get me ahead of other people in the same field as me. I love corgis and I hate peanut butter. Enough about me, who are you?
